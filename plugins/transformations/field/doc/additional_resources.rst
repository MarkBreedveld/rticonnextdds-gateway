Additional Resources
********************

This section contains a list of additional resources for |RSTSFM|.
The following resources are not detailed in this documentation because
they contain their own README file.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

There is only one example that uses |RSTSFM|, it is located under
``<|RTI_CONNEXT_GATEWAYS|'s main folder>/examples/mqtt/mqtt-shapes``.
If you have provided CMake with an installation directory, it will be under
``<CMake Installation directory>/examples/mqtt/mqtt-shapes``.
